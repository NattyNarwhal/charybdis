QS       - supports quit storm (SQUIT does not have to send recursive quits)
EX       - supports ban exceptions (+e)
CHW      - supports messages directed to channel operators only, i.e. @#channel
IE       - supports invite exceptions (+I)
KLN      - supports remote KLINE
KNOCK    - supports KNOCK (request invite to +ikl channel)
ZIP      - supports ziplinks
TB       - supports topic burst
UNKLN    - supports remote UNKLINE
CLUSTER  - supports remote XLINE, UNXLINE, RESV, UNRESV and LOCOPS
ENCAP    - supports message encapsulation
SERVICES - supports ratbox-services
RSFNC    - supports services forced nick change
SAVE     - supports forced nick change on nick collision
EUID     - supports EUID, non-ENCAP CHGHOST and NICKDELAY
EOPMOD   - supports EOPMOD (+z and ETB)
BAN      - supports propagated bans
MLOCK    - supports MLOCK messages
REMOVE   - supports REMOVE (alternative to KICK, provided by m_remove extension)

Not all TSora IRCD support these.

The KLN, UNKLN and CLUSTER capabilities do not apply to klines, xlines and resvs sent over ENCAP.

Disabling ban/invite exceptions in ircd.conf does not remove the EX/IE capabilities.
